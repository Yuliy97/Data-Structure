# Data-Structure
#### This repository contains implementation for multiple data structure in Java.
### Linkedlist
#### Linkedlist list is a liner data structure similar to arrays that is used to store data. However, unlike Array and Arraylist datas are stored in a node in the Linkedlist and nodes are connected with pointers. 
### Queue
#### Queue is a data sturcture that orders the datas in FIFO (first in first out) manner. This repository contains two implementations of the queue, one backed by an Array and one backed by a Linkedlist.
### Stack
#### Stack is a data sturcture that orders the datas in LIFO (last in first out) manner. This repository contains two implementations of the stack, one backed by an Array and the other backed by a Linkedlist.
